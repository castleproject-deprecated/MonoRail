# Using Resources to Store Views

Aside from the file system you can have views on the resource assemblies. This feature was introduced due to a necessity to reuse controllers, filters and views among projects, for example an user administration module.

To configure the assemblies that have views, use the `additionalSources` configuration node. See MonoRail Configuration Reference document.
